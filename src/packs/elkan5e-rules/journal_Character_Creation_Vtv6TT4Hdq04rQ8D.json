Barbarians fight recklessly, throwing themselves into a mighty rage which allows them to shrug off grievous wounds.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.SmG14gsqWBtqmcjt]{Bard}: performers, musicians, and explorers. Bards use magic, martial skill, and inspiring performances to support the other members of the party.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.Z68Q5K5fejrVQZAy]{Cleric}: scholars, missionaries, and preachers.

They are commonly, but not always, skilled healers.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.653LgVa3sG4ek6b5]{Druid}: hermits, shamans, and wild people.

They are often strongly aligned with nature or animals.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.a8ophKCiEGZarsnk]{Fighter}: professional warriors, guards, or gladiators. Fighters hone their martial skill above all other classes. They use a variety of weapons and can push their bodies further than others.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.VQiQktedzIusKs4y]{Monk}: wise recluses, honed athletes, or the magically awakened. Monks are able to harness magic in the air around them to perform fantastical attacks, move with lightning speed, and strike with powerful martial arts.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.Zg89AoSarbFbVnPY]{Paladin}: holy warriors, local champions, or obsessed avengers. Paladins draw powerful magic by swearing a magical oath. They heal and deal devastating damage with radiant attacks.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.t9qEzMyJh0kg5Djk]{Ranger}: wanderers, regional wardens, or monster hunters. Rangers easily circumvent obstacles and have magical powers they draw from nature or powerful honed instincts.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.RTS23KqJMFWlzLKd]{Rogue}: criminals, spies, or secret agents.

Sorcerers were born with magical abilities they often don't understand. They can shape spells to be more powerful than other spellcasters.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.Hnht9LDuOKTtKyiS]{Warlock}: devoted servants, desperate heroes, and fools tricked into pacts. Warlocks draw magical power from their connection to supernatural entities. They have a versatile set of gifts from their patrons but have fewer spells than other spellcasters.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.qM0tUqAZW3V8L4pF]{Wizard}: scholars, court mages, and backwater dabblers.

There are six</p><h2>Ability Scores</h2><h3>Strength</h3><p>Physical strength and athletic ability.</p><h3>Dexterity</h3><p>hand-eye coordination and reflexes.</p><h3>Constitution</h3><p>Physical resilience and endurance.</p><h3>Intelligence</h3><p>Problem solving ability and knowledge.</p><h3>Wisdom</h3><p>Social intuition and willpower.</p><h3>Charisma</h3><p>Personal magnetism and ability to influence others.</p><p></p><h2>Generating your Ability Scores</h2><p>At level 1, each of your ability scores will be between 8 and 17 (under most circumstances). If you have 10 in an ability score, you are at the human average for that score. Your character will be significantly above average overall. The easiest way to determine your ability scores is to choose the recommended ability scores for each class. In total, there are four ways to get your ability scores. </p><p>Note: Using any of Elkan's Ability Score systems, your character's Ancestry has no impact on Ability Scores, unlike in baseline 5e rules.</p><h3>A) Recommended Ability Scores: </h3><p>You can take the recommended ability scores for your class, linked here: @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.M8lNLAe2okA9qgFg]{Barbarian}, @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.SmG14gsqWBtqmcjt]{Bard}, @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.Z68Q5K5fejrVQZAy]{Cleric}, @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.653LgVa3sG4ek6b5]{Druid}, @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.a8ophKCiEGZarsnk]{Fighter}, @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.VQiQktedzIusKs4y]{Monk}, @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.Zg89AoSarbFbVnPY]{Paladin}, @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.t9qEzMyJh0kg5Djk]{Ranger}, @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.RTS23KqJMFWlzLKd]{Rogue}, @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.emEIZZAh0s8Ed62c]{Sorcerer}, @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.Hnht9LDuOKTtKyiS]{Warlock}, @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.qM0tUqAZW3V8L4pF]{Wizard}.</p><h3>B) Standard Array: </h3><p>You can assign a standard set of numbers to ability scores of your choice. Assign one of the following sets of numbers:</p><p>16, 14, 14, 12, 12, 8</p><p>16, 16, 14, 10, 10, 8</p><h3>C) Rolling: </h3><p>If you want to randomly determine your ability score values, you can roll for them.</p><p>Roll 4d6, dropping the lowest value. For example, if you roll, 5,4,4, 3, your total is 13. Repeat this six times, writing down the values you roll.</p><p>Assign each value to ability scores of your choice.</p><p>Add three points either to one ability score or split them up between different ability scores, up to a maximum of 17. If you rolled a 17 or 18, you can keep them, but not increase them this way.</p><h3>D) Point Buy</h3><p>You can spend points on your ability scores, dividing them however you want, between a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 17 for each score. You have 33 points.</p><table border=\"1\"><caption></caption><thead><tr><td><strong>Ability Score Value</strong></td><td><strong>Point Cost</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>8</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>13</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Ability Score Modifiers</h2><p>Once you have your Ability Scores, you can write them in the big boxes on the left side of your character sheet. Each has a small oval at the bottom. This is where you will write your Ability Score Modifiers.</p><p>Most of the time, Ability Scores do not directly affect your abilities. Instead, you will use your Ability Score Modifier, which is a smaller number that you add directly to an ability.</p><p>A modifier is calculated by subtracting 10 from your Ability Score, dividing by 2, and then rounding down. For example, a 14 in Strength gives you a Strength Modifier of 2. This means that when you get to add your 'Strength Modifier' or 'Strength' to a dice roll, you add +2.</p><p>Your Ability Score Modifiers will be very important.</p><p>Modifiers:</p><p>  8-9   (score) = -1 (modifier) </p><p>10-11 (score) =  0  (modifier) </p><p>12-13 (score) = +1 (modifier) </p><p>14-15 (score) = +2 (modifier) </p><p>16-17 (score) = +3 (modifier) </p>",

These are abilities and powers that your character develops as they gain levels and become more powerful. Luckily for you, you are a level 1 character, and only have a small portion of these abilities right now.

For now, I'll list a couple important things.</p><ul><li><p>When you 'have advantage' on a check or roll, that means you can roll twice and take the higher of the two.</p></li><li><p>Some abilities refer to @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.JournalEntry.eS0uzU55fprQJqIt]{Conditions}, which are effects that linger on a character, usually for a short time.</p></li><li><p>In combat, your characters take turns. On your turn, you can move, use an 'action', and sometimes use a 'bonus action'. You can also use your 'reaction' on the turns of other characters to react to something happening, and once you use a reaction you have to wait until your turn to use another reaction. If an ability specificies that is uses one of these three types of 'actions', it is important to write that down.</p></li><li><p>Some abilities can only be used a certain number of times before your character has to rest. Some require only a 'short rest' to replenish and some require a 'long rest'. This is also important to write down.</p></li><li><p>It's okay to summarize abilities, but if you don't fully understand, write it down exactly and ask an experienced player or your Game Master to explain it.</p></li><li><p>Some abilities will give you extra bonuses to things you've already written down. Fighters get a Fighting Style at level 1 that might add an extra bonus to their weapon attacks or damage. Rogues get Expertise, which allows them to double their proficiency bonus when rolling certain skills. I usually note Expertise on the sheet with a double checkmark in the skill bubble. Rogues may want to wait until they get skills from their Ancestry and Background before choosing which skills to have Expertise in. Monks get Martial Arts attacks, which aren't listed under equipment. Some classes, like Barbarian and Rogue, have abilities that add extra damage to their attacks sometimes, which you might want to list beneath your attacks.</p></li></ul></div>"
