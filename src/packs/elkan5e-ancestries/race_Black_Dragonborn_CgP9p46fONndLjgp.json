Those without draconic ancestry almost never survive. After this process, dragonborn belong to a 'Bloodline', corresponding to the color of the dragon whose blood awakened them. The chromatic dragons- the red, blue, green, white, and black dragons- forcibly control their dragonborn servants. Belonging to one of the chromatic bloodlines means that you likely had to escape. The metallic dragons- the gold, silver, bronze, brass, and copper dragons- are more benevolent and allow dissatisfied dragonborn to venture into the world.</em></p><p><em>Regardless, joining a Bloodline means you are unable to join another (trying would kill you), and you will forever have impulses to act similarly to the personalities of your Bloodlines. While you can control these impulses, it is a lifelong struggle.</em></p><p><em>The black dragons of Elkan live in the swamps of Ananua, where they mercilessly hunt whatever intelligent prey they can find. They enjoy inflicting horrible pain upon sentient creatures.\u00a0</em><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><em>Members of the Black Bloodline</em></span><em> feel an intrusive sense of satisfaction from watching creatures in physical pain.</em></p>",
