Changelings are usually born to changeling or shapeshifting parents. If either parent was shapeshifting during conception or pregnancy, the child may be changed and become a changeling prior to birth. As a result, spellcasters or parents who have been cursed may give birth to a changeling and find themselves horrified or unprepared for the shapeshifting blob. Young changelings often face much ridicule, as their impulsive shapeshifting may cause social difficulties growing up.</em></p>",
