The product of strange asexual reproduction, most minotaurs are born into male bodies, though exceptions tend to be the rule with minotaurs. Minotaurs often have eccentric interests or powerful innate magical abilities. The largest minotaur population is in Mothside City, Baphomet's favourite mortal city, though many live within The Maze, the paradoxical demiplane that is Baphomet's own mind. Baphomet can be seen on our home page.</em></p><p>\u200b</p>",
