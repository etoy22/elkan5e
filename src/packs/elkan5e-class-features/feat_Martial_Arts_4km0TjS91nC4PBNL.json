            "value": "<p>Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes in addition to weapons.</p><p>You gain the following benefits while you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p><ul><li><p>You roll a d6 in place of the normal damage dice of your unarmed strike. This die increases to 1d8 at level 5, 1d10 at level 11, and 1d12 at level 17, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.VQiQktedzIusKs4y]{monk table}. These increases are also listed later on this page.</p></li><li><p>You can choose to wield a weapon as a monk weapon. You must be proficient with the weapon, and it can't have the &amp;reference[Heavy] property. Your can use your Martial Arts die for damage rolls with monk weapons instead of the weapon's normal damage dice.\u00a0</p></li><li><p>On a turn where you take the &amp;reference[Attack] action using an unarmed strike or a monk weapon, and you have an empty second hand, you can make an unarmed strike as if your empty hand were an off-hand weapon, without the normal penalties for off-hand weapons.</p></li><li><p>You can use dexterity instead of strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</p></li><li><p>For the purpose of other abilities, your unarmed strikes count as having the &amp;reference[finesse] and &amp;reference[lightw] properties. As normal, whether you are a monk or not, your unarmed attacks count as attacks with a melee weapon.</p></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p><em>If you take the Attack action and attack with a spear, you can use your dexterity for the attack roll. The spear would deal (1d6+dex) in damage if wielded one-handed and (1d8+dex) in damage if wielded two handed. However, a spear wielded by a level 20 monk would deal (1d12+dex) damage, because the monk's unarmed die is a d12, which is higher than the weapon's normal damage die.</em></p><p><em>If the monk was wielding the spear with one hand, the monk can also make an unarmed strike as part of the attack action. This is in line with our general changes to @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.nfEDSQG0DMBs7eGp.JournalEntryPage.0mJgDHc69dAZQtRr#dual-wielding]{dual wielding}. Unlike dual wielding with weapons, a monk does not need to have the @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class-features.ipFfwmfAjjuNXaru]{Two-Weapon Fighting Style} to fight effectively in this way. A monk is trained in making many attacks in a short time.</em></p>",
