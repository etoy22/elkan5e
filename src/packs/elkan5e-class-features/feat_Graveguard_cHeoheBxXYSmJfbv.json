            "value": "<p><em>All necromancers can raise the dead, but those who specialize in its magic are usually accompanied by a graveguard, an undead servant who willingly bound their undying soul to the necromancer. They could be a loyal follower, a dead friend or lover, or even a childhood pet.</em></p><p>​</p><p><strong>To use this feature, use one of the graveguard actors from the Elkan 5e Summoned Creatures compendium. You level up your graveguard when you level up.</strong></p><p>You raise a graveguard to serve you. This undead creature will level up when you level up as a wizard, and will be your graveguard until you die or until you raise a new graveguard during a long rest. If you change to a new graveguard, your old graveguard dies.​​​</p><ul><li><p>Your graveguard’s proficiency bonus is equal to yours.</p></li><li><p>Your graveguard understands all languages you do, and can speak whatever languages they had while alive.</p></li><li><p>When you and your graveguard take a short rest together and you expend hit dice to regain hit points, your graveguard regains the same number of hit points.</p></li><li><p>When a graveguard reaches 0, they die, leaving their body or residue behind. A graveguard remains dead until their necromancer finishes a long rest, or until healed by the necromancer, at which point their body (or spectral form) instantly reforms.</p></li><li><p>Your graveguard acts on their own initiative in combat, but you control them.</p></li></ul><p>​</p><p>You can make one of three difference kinds of graveguard, which changes what they can do.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-summoned-creatures.Actor.A0daIcZf4gqLTxQx]{Cadaverous Graveguard}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-summoned-creatures.Actor.er5obJLoWkRJnirv]{Skeletal Graveguard}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-summoned-creatures.Actor.cpIgcOpmk6YiimMw]{Spectral Graveguard}</p>",
