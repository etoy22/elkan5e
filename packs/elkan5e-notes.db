The problem is, there's no reason why studs on leather armor would be very useful, and there's no historical precedence for their use. It's likely that studded leather was created as fantasy armor as a misunderstanding of brigandine, which has metal plates beneath leather riveted in place, which on the outside would look like studded leather armor. Conversely, padded armor in 5e was barely in use, but realistically it would be used by most poor soldiers and beginning adventurers rather than leather. We shuffled things around. See below for more information on our light armor (2).</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>Ring Mail is also a fictional armor likely born of misinterpretation. It is supposed to consist of rings fixed to a leather layers, but the rings are not linked together. This was likely fabricated based on medieval depictions of chain mail, which, due to artistic style choices (or artistic incompetence) were often depicted with the chain links drawn as disconnected circles on top of leather coats, rather than as an interconnected mesh. However, these historical depictions were meant to depict chain mail over a leather or cloth padding. Since we, as designers and players of 5e have never had a character wear ring mail, we removed it entirely. Its only function was as starting armor for characters with low strength and dexterity, and ring mail isn't even listed as a starting armor for anyone. In practice we never saw it used, so we didn't replace it.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>@Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.axmmw27K4D0THVDB]{(2)} Regarding Light Armor: </p>\n<p>In baseline 5e, the worst light armor is padded armor, and it appears as we feature it here, except that it imposes disadvantage on stealth checks. This made no sense to us, as other armor that includes padded layers did not impose this disadvantage. However, by removing the disadvantage, we made padded just as good as leather armor. However, because we wanted to remove studded leather armor, we simply gave leather armor the statistics that leather armor used to have (with a slight cost decrease).</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>However, other 5e materials will still use the old names. If you are using other 5e sources that reference 'studded leather armor', give it the statistics of leather armor as we list it here. They are identical. If other sources list 'leather armor', use the statistics of padded armor here. For example, if you create a character at level 1 that starts with leather armor, then that character should start with padded armor instead. If you accidentally give the armor the statistics of leather armor instead of padded armor, it's no big deal. There's a very small difference and it's only meant to make a character's starting armor slightly worse. If you see padded armor in other 5e material (and it's very rare), improve the padded armor to the statistics we provide here.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ymJDAw0PgXIWIHMH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.9BLbAKTciyIk82nU"}}}

However, at high levels it was easily possible for a fighter to have a 10% chance of success, where rolling again would be unlikely to succeed. We also didn't like that an ability called Indomitable would be used up when a character fails a save. Thus, we allow the fighter to add 1d10, which is a much more substantial bonus to their chance of success than a reroll.</p>\n<p>If a fighter uses @Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-class-features.XXB8JdlvKIksSmR7]{Indomitable} and still fails the saving throw, the ability is not consumed. The fighter can then use @Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-class-features.XXB8JdlvKIksSmR7]{Indomitable} again the next time the fighter fails a save. The fighter only consumes a use of @Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-class-features.XXB8JdlvKIksSmR7]{Indomitable} when the 1d10 causes the fighter to succeed on a save. At higher levels, the fighter will have the ability to turn more than one failure into a success per long rest.</p>\n<p>If the fighter has a very low chance of suceeding even with @Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-class-features.XXB8JdlvKIksSmR7]{Indomitable}, it is still best to try to roll it, because the ability is not consumed if it fails.

While charmed by the dryad, the charmed creature takes the dryad's requests as favorably as possible. However, when a wizard then casts charm person on the same goblin, the charmed humanoid can freely decide to disobey the wizard's order as much as they want. Similarly, if an ability says it causes a condition like charmed without any further detail, it only does what is listed here.</p>\n<p>The goblin is simultaneously affected by both charm effects. The goblin is only free of will once both charm effects end.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>@Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.FPAnVs7fh9rzAnkT]{(2)} Regarding the blinded condition</p>\n<p>The blinded condition in 5e is not always intuitive. An archer can attack any creature they want while blinded, only suffering disadvantage. We tested several other ways to run blindness, but if we want to preserve existing 5e abilities we had to keep the condition roughly the same. We added a few penalties so that blindness would apply to a wider ranger of abilities. We didn't want to make it impossible for a blinded wizard to cast fireball, and practically the wizard's player will be able to see the monsters, so we decided that a blind wizard probably can't aim a fireball very well. </p>\n<p>A blinded creature knows where other creatures are for the sake of moving closer to them. The DM may rule that a blinded character is unaware of things in their environment beyond what the blinded condition prescribes.</p>\n<p>A DM may wish to rule that a blinded spellcaster can occassionally cast spells that normally require line of sight. We recommend allowing blinded casters to cast such spells when in physical contact with the target, such as when the caster is grappling an enemy, or when the spellcaster is swallowed by a large creature.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.FPAnVs7fh9rzAnkT]{(3} </span>An example of the blinded condition interacting with blindsight:</p>\n<p>An Adult Red Dragon has a blindsight of 60 ft. This means if the dragon is blinded, a fighter attacking the dragon with a melee attack does not get advantage on the attack roll, because the dragon can see the fighter. However, an archer 100 ft. away does have advantage on attack rolls against the dragon because the dragon cannot see the archer.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>@Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.ABTDKZmH0zOlHn9n]{(4)} Regarding the charmed condition: </p>\n<p>A charmed creature might be in awe of their charmer or consider them very likeable, even if that would not normally make sense.</p>\n<p>If a player character is charmed, the player should be in charge of how their character behaves. However, if the character is the subject of a charm effect like a vampire's Charm ability, the player character may have to follow certain rules or guidelines. In a few cases, a charm effect may allow the charmer total control of the charmed creature.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>@Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.ytWLXLrjrTD0Ad4g]{(5)} Regarding sources of the frightened condition:</p>\n<p>In the case where the source of the fear is invisible or hidden, the DM may rule whether the frightened creature suffers the penalties of this condition or not. An invisible hag might have frightened a character, but the character might not know the hag is in the room, and so might not have disadvantage on rolls. Or perhaps the character knows the hag is right behind a door, and is affected as if the hag was within line of sight. The DM decides whether the creature is affected in these cases.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the DM might decide a creature can move closer to the source of its fear temporarily, if it means the creature can end their turn further away.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>@Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.TZySYSl98oKI9hV8]{(6)} An example of the grappled condition:</p>\n<p>A vampire spawn grapples a commoner. The vampire spawn then moves 15 ft., which, since the vampire spawn's speed is 30, is all of the vampire spawn's movement. Then a guard shoves the vampire spawn, moving the spawn 5 ft. This frees the commoner from the grappled condition.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>@Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.pMxJOwbN5LJQ1XVo]{(7)} Changes to the incapacitated condition:</p>\n<p>In the baseline 5e ruleset, the paralyzed, petrified, stunned, and unconscious conditions all caused the affected creature to be incapacitated, but the conditions were not explicitly linked. This is a simpler model.</p>\n<p>There was only one example in 5e where a creature could be incapacitated and not have their speed reduced to 0, so we added the speed reduction to the incapacitated condition. However, for the purpose of the hideous laughter spell, you may wish for a creature's speed to not become 0. Effects that cause incapacitation from other sources may require a small adjustment.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>(8) Regarding ranged attacks made against @Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.TAodXxiJ9vgU6uHy]{Paralyzed} and @Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.mjdJMBJNhsMBL2pY]{Unconscious} creatures:​</p>\n<p>A ranged attack made from 30 ft. away against a paralyzed target has advantage.</p>\n<p>A ranged attack made from 30 ft. away against an unconscious target has advantage and disadvantage (because the unconscious creature is prone). In this case, the attack is rolled without advantage or disadvantage.</p>\n<p>A ranged attack made from within 5 ft. against a paralyzed or unconscious creature has advantage and disadvantage. The attack is rolled without advantage or disadvantage. Such a ranged attack becomes a critical hit as long as it hits.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>@Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.OFL6FfkpjjgzzY4G]{(9)} Regarding the invisible condition:</p>\n<p>The invisible creature still leaves tracks and makes sound. We recommend that all creatures should know the location of an invisible creature in combat unless that creature is hiding. Note that some creatures or characters may be able to attack and hide in the same turn, and invisible creatures do not provoke attacks of opportunity, so some invisible creatures can attack, move, and then hide in an unknown location.</p>\n<p>If a creature has blindsight, truesight, or some other way of seeing invisible creautres, the invisible creature gains no benefit against the creature that can see them.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>@Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.eIrv6JmGsd1czrvu]{(10)} An example of the prone condition:</p>\n<p>A commoner is shoved prone by a zombie. Another zombie then rolls an attack against the commoner, rolling with advantage. A skeleton archer 40 ft. from the commoner then attacks the commoner, rolling the attack roll with disadvantage. Then a second skeleton archer moves to a spot within 5 ft. of the prone commoner, rolling its attack roll without disadvantage or advantage. While normally a point blank shot would have disadvantage, the advantage granted by being within 5 ft. of the prone target causes the roll to be made normally. </p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>@Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.G4mu6r8IOLv6lyCQ]{(11)} Regarding the surprised condition:</p>\n<p>One member of the party may be surprised while others are not. Perhaps the goblins sneaking up on your party caught the ranger's attention, but not the wizard's.</p>\n<p>The DM may decide that the surprised condition is appropriate outside of an ambush. If a doppleganger suddenly sheds their disguise and attacks, the victims are likely surprised, unless they knew the doppleganger was in disguise. Another example would be a supposedly friendly merchant suddenly unleashing a fireball spell upon the party. In this case, you would likely roll the shopkeeper's deception against the party's passive insight scores, similar to stealth in an ambush scenario. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>​</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ymJDAw0PgXIWIHMH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.rjh8Cu2h5h7qn9cn"}}}

We also gave them a feature at level 10 that allows them to bolster their wisdom saves for high level play, and we created a new capstone feature to replace their old one, which we invalidated by allowing level 2 and higher sorcerers to regain sorcery points on a short rest. Also, in baseline 5e, sorcery points could be abused to create an unlimited number of spell slots for certain multiclass characters.
