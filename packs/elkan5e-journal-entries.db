Practitioners describe their lion and goat as mainly symbolic. While the lion and the goat may be regarded as holy animals, no animal is directly revered or worshipped. House Batari founded this belief system to spread the idea that focusing on one's own happiness was the best way to achieve happiness. What started as a philosophy of self-help and spiritual satisfaction quickly spread and caused the formation of several religious sects. Batari Dualism is now the dominant religion in Mahavala, Jayadi, and Karsa. Mahavala remains the center of worship, with House Batari still at its core.</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"line-height:1.8em\">All sects of the Batari Church agree on the same core principles. Self-actualization comes from knowing yourself and living in a way that is true to yourself. Pleasure comes from the simple things that make you feel good in the moment. Seeking both self-actualization and pleasure is the only way to be happy. It is both fortunate and unfortunate that the Batari Church does not try to control its followers as they seek happiness. Because the faith is so self-focused, most of the Church's elite are interested only in feeling good about themselves. High Priest Aritido, for example, speaks often about how helping others find the path to happiness is the most rewarding thing in the world. Aritido also keeps a large number of slaves on his private property. That the path to happiness is not equally available to everyone is an accepted fact of life in the Batari Church, and the more fortunate members of society are encouraged to exploit their positions.</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"line-height:1.8em\">Each province of Mahavala is ruled by a tycoon, each representing a captain of industry who distinguished themselves as paragons of their own personal success. Most were born rich into the Batari family, but there are exceptions. There is a lot of difference in belief between Tycoons. Tycoon Hasin the Lion believes that people should seek communal success and elevate each other. Tycoon Sitraka Batari believes the spread of religious writings dulls the mind, and that people should only rely on their own thoughts for answers. Tycoon Miora believes that people should live with animals, and that the secret to true happiness lies in literal communication with 'wise' beasts.</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"line-height:1.8em\">All agree that the weak deserve their place in squalor because they are not strong enough to find happiness. Hasin the Lion, however, believes that some slaves should be elevated according to talent, and some weak nobles should be cast down. The other tycoons believe that inherent ability doesn't matter, and that Hasin is too concerned with the well-being of others for their own tastes. However, they recognize that helping others makes him happy, which they consider a good thing.</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/elkan5e/images/Batari%20cropped.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"KBk3jUHFhbZRgwIy":3},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"","sourceId":"JournalEntry.KNwHpjQKKClb2OEg"}},"_id":"EFqjm7ISQlwEThRr"}

Without a keen mind, happiness is fragile and fleeting.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"comp-ky0rkbnx\" class=\"_2Hij5\" data-testid=\"richTextElement\">\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"line-height:1.8em\">When Iveta Dzene was born to a religious family, she quickly became a source of trouble. She withdrew from society, calling her family and peers fools for following what she considered such an obvious lie. The Batari Church, she said, had nothing of value to say, regardless of sect or personal interpretation. Life was meaningless, and their attempts to instill some meaning in the pursuit of fleeting happiness was evidence of their idiocy and suggestibility and nothing else.</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"line-height:1.8em\">With a great disdain for the Lion and the Goat, Iveta Dzene created the first chimera, fusing a lion and a goat together and adding a long tail with the head of a snake at the end. This act is refered to as the Chimera Heresy. She released it in Tyopalvka, House Batari's northernmost colony. It devoured hundreds of people, according to legend, before escaping into the underworld. When the priest of her village came to ask her for answers, he asked her why she had added a snake. She laughed and told him there was no reason at all. She just added a snake because she had a snake, and that was just as arbitrary as anything the Batari Church ever had to say or do. Iveta used the chimeras to drive House Batari from Tyopalvka. She then founded House Dzene before being slain and rising as an archdemon, retreating into the underworld.</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"line-height:1.8em\">This story should have ended here, but House Dzene adopted the Chimera as their sigil, specifically attempting to incense their former overlords. Eventually, an anonymous Dzene wizard published 'The Pain of Stupidity', a book meant to use the snake as a metaphor for intelligence, claiming that the Batari Church was too stupid to find happiness because they neglected to include reason as a core virtue. While this was likely meant to provoke outrage, instead it caused a small schism in House Batari. One of the Tycoons, a rebellious elf named Nye Batari, decided that The Pain of Stupidity was a brilliant condemnation of the establishment. She then formed her own sect of Batari Dualism which survives to this day.</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"line-height:1.8em\">Despite being commonly branded as a heretic, Tycoon Agraynel Batari claims that only with a sharp mind and forward thinking can happiness be sustained. While he and his followers are by far the largest group of genuine followers of a related faith, the Chimera Heresy also refers to the ongoing vitriol House Dzene aims at Batari Dualism. Some members of House Dzene identify as practitioners of the Chimera Heresy, but they do not consider themselves religious or a part of Nye Batari's sect of the Batari faith.</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/elkan5e/images/Dzene%20cropped.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"KBk3jUHFhbZRgwIy":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ChKnf3TvsAIl6ByN"}},"_id":"zZvDKahpF618wYk4"}
