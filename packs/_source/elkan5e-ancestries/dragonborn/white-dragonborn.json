Those without draconic ancestry almost never survive. After this process, dragonborn belong to a 'Bloodline', corresponding to the color of the &amp;reference[dragon] whose blood awakened them. The chromatic dragons- the red, blue, green, white, and black dragons- forcibly control their dragonborn servants. Belonging to one of the chromatic bloodlines means that you likely had to escape. The metallic dragons- the gold, silver, bronze, brass, and copper dragons- are more benevolent and allow dissatisfied dragonborn to venture into the world.</em></p><br><p><em>Regardless, joining a Bloodline means you are unable to join another (trying would kill you), and you will forever have impulses to act similarly to the personalities of your Bloodlines. While you can control these impulses, it is a lifelong struggle.</em></p><br><p><em>The white dragons of Elkan live in remote tundras, hiding from their many draconic enemies. They are bullies, taking out their anger on whoever is smaller than them.</em> <em>Members of the White Bloodline</em> <em>have intrusive thoughts that the only way to overcome their own weaknesses is to victimize others.</em></p>",
