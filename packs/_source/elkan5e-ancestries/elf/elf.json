The pale High Elves of Ishiki live an isolationist life on their hidden island, but exiles from their lands have colonized much of the main continent. The tanned Wood Elves of Ananua, so named for the boats they built after cutting sacred forests, live in shrouded settlements in the south of Elkan. By far the most numerous are the brown-skinned Dark Elves, who have founded several prominent merchant houses in the north of Elkan. Unlike many other settings, the different ethnic groups of elves in Elkan are nearly identical biologically.</em></p>",
