			"value": "<p>Genasi are usually humanoids with partial elemental ancestry. Sometimes a genasi is created by fusing a humanoid with elemental magic. While they are mortal, and may not have been born on one of the elemental planes, they nonetheless bear many traits of elemental creatures. Earth genasi are usually the descendants of mortals and dao. They are dense and strong as stone, and often bear other signs of their elemental lineage, such as earthen brown-grey skin, a wide build, or rocky protrusions from their body.</p><p><strong>Type:</strong> &amp;Reference[Elemental]{Elemental}</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium or Small</p><p><strong>Walking Speed:</strong> 30 ft.</p><p><strong>Senses:</strong> &amp;Reference[Darkvision] 60 ft.</p><p><strong>Cantrips:</strong> <em>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-spells.Item.xw35KW3YQQkg2Zn4]{Mending}</em></p><p><strong>Damage Resistance:</strong> &amp;reference[Lightning]</p><p><strong>Language:</strong> You can read and write @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-rules.JournalEntry.5l8QNlgPDPOHpGID.JournalEntryPage.VZggCkMcvhk0X5Xj#primordial]{Primordial} and speak its Terran dialect.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-ancestries.Item.5sGc2Tsu23jDaBS3]{Sturdy}</strong> </p><p></p><p><em>In the world of Elkan, genasi are rare except in regions with an active portal to one of the elemental planes. Each of the elemental planes has one major gateway that allows travelers to move between planes. Each of these portals are either remote, guarded, or difficult to reach. In Elkan, earth genasi rarely congregate in groups. The Plane of Earth itself is so hostile that the tunnel cities there are constantly shifting, and mortals almost never live there. On the Material Plane, it's said that the portal to the Plane of Earth is deep below the Ashen Mountains on the Morventry border, but the tunnels of the underworld in the region are extremely hostile. There is a rumored secret organization of earth genasi on the pirate island of Lennington, but most genasi don't have a sense of community or connection to their home.</em></p><p></p>",
