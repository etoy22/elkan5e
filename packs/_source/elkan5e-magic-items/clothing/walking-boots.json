			"value": "<p><em>These boots were created for wealthy adventurers who wanted to walk through treacherous terrain. They are ostentatious, but extremely practical. The enchantments are probably more complex than any adventurer realistically needs.</em></p><p>When attuned to the item, you suffer no movement penalty from difficult terrain. You can walk on the surface of water if moving at no more than half your speed. If you move faster, are pushed, or choose to sink you can fall into water as normal. If swimming at the surface of water, you can use half your movement to stand up on the water.</p>",
