			"value": "<p>When you deal @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class-features.Item.8Ctt1vOsZuKXxAIN]{Sneak Attack} damage, you can sacrifice damage on your attack for a secondary effect. This can reduce your sneak attack damage to 0, but still add a secondary effect. Sometimes, these sneak attack options change the damage type of your sneak attack damage. Some require you to be within 5 ft. of your target. Otherwise, these options function exactly the same as Sneak Attack.</p><p></p><p>When a sneak attack option requires the target to roll a saving throw, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your strength or dexterity modifier (whichever is higher).</p>",
