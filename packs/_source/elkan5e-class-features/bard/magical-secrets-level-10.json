The spells can be from different classes, but this time they must be a cantrip or a spell of<strong>3rd level</strong> or lower, as opposed to the previous limit of 1st level. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you, and they count as extra known spells, meaning they don't count against the number of spells you know.<span></span><span>You can exchange a spell learned from Magical Secrets when you level up, like with other spells.</span></p>",
