The spells can be from different classes, but this time they must be a cantrip or a spell of<strong>7th level</strong> or lower, as opposed to the previous limit of 5th level. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you, and they count as extra known spells, meaning they don't count against the number of spells you know.</p>",
