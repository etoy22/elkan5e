			"value": "<p><strong>Bonus Action</strong> - Self - 8 Hours - Magical</p><p>You can magically assume the shape of a chosen beast. Choose two CR 0 beasts that don't have a flying speed. You can transform only into these creatures. You can swap which beast forms you know when you level up or finish a long rest.</p><p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p><ul><li><p>You retain your normal hit points and your mind, including your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, ancestry, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision or keen smell, unless your new form also has that sense.</p></li><li><p>Your other game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, including but not limited to the new form's Strength, Dexterity, Consitution, Armor Class, and movement speeds.</p></li><li><p>You retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the chosen creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours.</p></li><li><p>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</p></li><li><p>You cannot cast spells in these forms unless you have the @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class-features.Item.hmliC9DvCFITKc1l]{Wild Shapeshifting} feature as a @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-subclass.Item.zcOFbSrLq7Npn6QD]{Circle of the Shifter} druid.</p></li></ul><p>You can stay in a beast shape for up to 8 hours or until you finish a short or long rest. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can end this ability earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall &amp;reference[unconscious], drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>",
