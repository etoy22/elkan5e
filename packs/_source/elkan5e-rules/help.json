				"content": "<p>If you want to use a subclass not originally designed for Elkan 5e, that's no problem. Here are the steps you need to take to ensure compatibility.</p><br><p><strong>Step 1: </strong> All subclasses now gain subclass features at levels 3, 6, 10, and 14 (except @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.t9qEzMyJh0kg5Djk]{Rangers}, who gain their third feature at level 11 instead of 10).</p><br><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.a8ophKCiEGZarsnk]{Fighters} gain an extra feature at level 18 and @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.Zg89AoSarbFbVnPY]{paladins} gain an extra one at level 20.</p><br><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.SmG14gsqWBtqmcjt]{Bards} now gain an ability at level 10. If you're playing a bard, you can gain a feat at level 10 instead, like @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-feats.Item.9dnjpqEg6ihL57Se]{Countercharm}.</p><br><p><strong>Step 2: </strong> If you're playing a full caster class that isn't bard, like @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.emEIZZAh0s8Ed62c]{sorcerer}, you get your expanded spell list at level 1, allowing you to start casting your extra level 1 spells right away.</p><br><p>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.653LgVa3sG4ek6b5]{Druids} should gain extra 1st level spells, and sorcerers should gain one extra spell per level. You may need to choose these spells yourself.</p><br><p>You do not gain any other level 1 subclass feature unless you are a sorcerer or a @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.qM0tUqAZW3V8L4pF]{wizard}. Wizards gain the ability to learn all spells from their chosen school, and sorcerers gain whichever of their 1st level features are most minor. The other feature(s) are gained at level 3.</p><br><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You may need to adjust features to fit with Elkan 5e. In particular, any feature that gives a @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.VQiQktedzIusKs4y]{monk} two attacks with their bonus action should only give one attack.</p><br><p>If playing a @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.Item.Zg89AoSarbFbVnPY]{paladin}, your oath will have two Channel Conviction options. If you choose an oath that's not from Elkan 5e, these will be labeled as 'Channel Divinity'. At level 3, you choose one of them, which you can use once between every short or long rest. The other you then gain at level 10.</p>"
