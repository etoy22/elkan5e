No two creatures of a given type are the same, but some features and spells affect specific creature types differently than others.</p><br><p>Every creature has at least one creature type, but may belong to more than one.</p><h4>&amp;reference[aberration]</h4><p>Aberrations are unnatural creatures. They are usually the unnatural results of magic or come from distant extraplanar places where the laws of reality are different. As opposed to monstrosities, aberrations can only exist because of magic or powerful otherworldly power.</p><h4>&amp;reference[beast]</h4><p>Beasts are naturally-occurring creatures on the material plane that are nonmagical, usually unintelligent, and not &amp;reference[humanoid]. Sometimes their species has a magical origin story but they have nonetheless become natural nonmagical parts of the ecosystem.</p><h4>&amp;reference[celestial]</h4><p>Celestials are magical extraplanar creatures who are usually the enemies of fiends. They often wield radiant energy and champion virtuous action. In most settings, they are tied to other planes of existence associated with gods or moral purity. Celestials are often severe or inflexible, which at worst makes them villains.</p><h4>&amp;reference[construct]</h4><p>Constructs are magical or artificial beings made from (usually) inorganic material. They were created by other creatures, usually with a purpose in mind.Â</p><h4>&amp;reference[dragon]</h4><p>Dragons are magical creatures who, above all else, are known for their powerful breath weapons. While the best known dragons are &amp;reference[giant] flying lizards, dragonkin, including the &amp;reference[humanoid] dragonborn, also count as dragons for the sake of abilities and magical effects.</p><h4>&amp;reference[elemental]</h4><p>Elementals are magical extraplanar creatures bound and shaped by one or more of the &amp;reference[elemental] planes. In most settings, elementals are tied to the elemental planes of air, earth, fire, and water, though your setting may have other elemental planes as well.</p><h4>&amp;reference[fey]</h4><p>&amp;reference[fey] are magical creatures, sometimes bound to another plane of existence where natural or primal magic originate from. fey are linked to the natural world, but exist outside its usual cycles, or are so infused with magic that they are inherently capable of things natural creatures are not. fey often appear like humanoids, beasts, or plants.</p><h4>&amp;reference[fiend]</h4><p>Fiends are magical extraplanar creatures who are usually the enemies of celestials (and other fiends, for that matter). They often wield fire or represent mortal vices. In most settings, they are tied to other planes of existence associated with suffering or immoral action. The link between fiends and mortal character flaws often makes them twisted villains.</p><h4>&amp;reference[giant]</h4><p>Giants are very large creatures that are almost always &amp;reference[humanoid] in shape. Many giants have magical forms or powers, such as frost giants or fire giants, but some appear to be nonmagical, such as ogres.</p><h4>&amp;reference[humanoid]</h4><p>&amp;reference[humanoid] is a catch-all term for creatures with legs, arms, and a head in a recognizably human-like form. Some humanoids have more limbs, but most have only two arms and two legs. Many creatures, like most giants, are technically humanoids, but are typically only listed under their non-humanoid creature type.</p><h4>&amp;reference[monstrosity]</h4><p>Monstrosities are the products of magic, but usually bear some resemblance to natural creatures. They often wield magical powers themselves (or else they would be a &amp;reference[beast], &amp;reference[humanoid], &amp;reference[ooze], or &amp;reference[plant]). A monster that doesn't fit into other categories is a &amp;reference[monstrosity].</p><h4>&amp;reference[ooze]</h4><p>Oozes are amorphic clusters of slime, bacteria, or other animate &amp;reference[ooze]-like material. Some oozes are naturally occurring (such as bacteria, molds, protists, or other clusters of life forms). Other oozes are created with magic, such as black puddings or sludge monsters. Oozes have no common origin, but to the casual observer, will seem to all be closely related.</p><h4>&amp;reference[plant]</h4><p>As a category, plants also include fungal creatures (which are sometimes also oozes). Plants are sometimes intelligent, and are closely related to mundane plants, which do not count as creatures. A &amp;reference[plant] is a creature if it can take actions, otherwise it is treated as an object.</p><h4>&amp;reference[undead]</h4><p>&amp;reference[undead] were once a different type of creature, before they died. Raised by magic, they now occupy the space between life and death. Often, they sustain themselves through unnatural means, or their bodies are damaged beyond normal functioning. Creatures who return to life in the same form as before their death are not undead.</p>"
