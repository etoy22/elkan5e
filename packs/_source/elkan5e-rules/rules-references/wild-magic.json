				"content": "<p>When you trigger a Wild Surge for any reason, you roll on the Wild Surge Table appropriate to the spell's level. Most of the time, your spell works as normal and you then you trigger a random secondary effect.</p><ul><li><p>If the wild surge has an effect that requires a saving throw, the DC is your &amp;reference[abilityspells]{spell save DC}.</p></li><li><p>You cannot wild surge more than once per turn.</p></li><li><p>Cantrips don't trigger wild surges. There are 10 wild surge tables. The first 9 correspond to spells of 1st through 9th level. The 10th level surge table is very dangerous and best avoided. If you somehow get a surge above 10th level, roll on the 10th level table.</p></li><li><p>Wild surges count as spells of the same level as the level of the table. They are subject to the same restrictions as other spells, such as &amp;reference[lineofsight] requirements.</p><br><p>If your surge requires you to choose a target and you don't want to target a creature within range, you can target an object, which may be relatively harmless.</p></li><li><p>If for any reason your spell is affected by more than one effect that causes a Wild Surge, then your Surge's level increases by one level for each triggering effect. For example, if you use @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class-features.Item.Cjd9KZdWZd7lum2H]{Voluntary Surge} as a @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-subclass.Item.vKEThfA1dQ17GXxI]{Wild Mage} sorcerer and cast a 1st level <em>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-spells.Item.wZJ04LVK8K0jSm1B]{magic missile}</em> in a wild magic zone where all spells are wild surges, you roll on the 2nd Level Surge Table instead of the 1st Level Surge Table. If you also trigger a random surge via the Wild Mage's @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class-features.Item.yXSOvWE0v2BWMshU]{Wild Surge} feature, you would then roll on the 3rd level table.</p></li></ul><p></p><br><p><strong>You can find the wild surge tables in the compendium tab under Elkan 5e -&gt; Other -&gt; Elkan 5e Roll Tables.</strong></p>"
