				"content": "<p>@UUID[.NmrCCN5LHdTpspXs]{(1)} An example of overlapping conditions:</p><p>A dryad can use &amp;reference[fey] charm to cause a goblin to be affected by the &amp;reference[Charmed] condition. While charmed by the dryad, the charmed creature takes the dryad's requests as favorably as possible. However, when a wizard then casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-spells.Item.4LmfNXTDDG0fITnF]{charm}</em> on the same goblin, the charmed &amp;reference[humanoid] can freely decide to disobey the wizard's order as much as they want. Similarly, if an ability says it causes a condition like Charmed without any further detail, it only does what is listed here.</p><p>The goblin is simultaneously affected by both charmed effects. The goblin is only completely clear of mind once both charmed effects end.</p><p>(2) Regarding the &amp;reference[blinded] condition</p><p>The blinded condition in 5e is not always intuitive. An archer can attack any creature they want while blinded, only suffering disadvantage.</p><p>A blinded creature knows where other creatures are for the sake of moving closer to them. The GM may rule that a blinded character is unaware of things in their environment beyond what the blinded condition prescribes.</p><p>A GM may wish to rule that a blinded spellcaster can occassionally cast spells that normally require line of sight. We recommend allowing blinded casters to cast such spells when in physical contact with the target, such as when the caster is grappling an enemy, or when the spellcaster is swallowed by a large creature.</p><p><span>(3) </span>An example of the &amp;reference[blinded] condition interacting with &amp;reference[blindsight]:</p><p>An Adult Red &amp;reference[dragon] has a blindsight of 60 ft. This means if the dragon is blinded, a fighter attacking the dragon with a melee attack does not get advantage on the attack roll, because the dragon can see the fighter. However, an archer 100 ft. away does have advantage on attack rolls against the dragon because the dragon cannot see the archer.</p><p>(4) Regarding the &amp;reference[charmed] condition:</p><p>A charmed creature might be in awe of their charmer or consider them very likeable, even if that would not normally make sense.</p><p>If a player character is charmed, the player should be in charge of how their character behaves. However, if the character is the subject of a charm effect like a vampire's Charm ability, the player character may have to follow certain rules or guidelines. In a few cases, a charm effect may allow the charmer total control of the charmed creature.</p><p>(5) Regarding sources of the &amp;reference[frightened] condition:</p><p>In the case where the source of the fear is &amp;reference[invisible] or hidden, the GM may rule whether the frightened creature suffers the penalties of this condition or not. An invisible hag might have frightened a character, but the character might not know the hag is in the room, and so might not have disadvantage on rolls. Or perhaps the character knows the hag is right behind a door, and is affected as if the hag was within line of sight. The GM decides whether the creature is affected in these cases.</p><p>(6) An example of the &amp;reference[grappled] condition:</p><p>A vampire spawn grapples a commoner. The vampire spawn then moves 15 ft., which, since the vampire spawn's speed is 30, is all of the vampire spawn's movement. Then a guard shoves the vampire spawn, moving the spawn 5 ft. This frees the commoner from the grappled condition.</p><p>(7) Regarding ranged attacks made against &amp;reference[Paralyzed] and &amp;reference[Unconscious] creatures:</p><p>A ranged attack made from 30 ft. away against a paralyzed target has advantage.</p><p>A ranged attack made from 30 ft. away against an unconscious target has advantage and disadvantage (because the unconscious creature is prone). In this case, the attack is rolled without advantage or disadvantage.</p><p>A ranged attack made from within 5 ft. against a paralyzed} or unconscious creature has advantage and disadvantage. The attack is rolled without advantage or disadvantage. Such a ranged attack becomes a critical hit as long as it hits.</p><p>(8) Regarding the &amp;reference[invisible] condition:</p><p>The invisible creature still leaves tracks and makes sound. We recommend that all creatures should know the location of an invisible creature in combat unless that creature is hiding. Note that some creatures or characters may be able to attack and hide in the same turn, and invisible creatures do not provoke attacks of opportunity, so some invisible creatures can attack, move, and then hide in an unknown location.</p><p>If a creature has blindsight, truesight, or some other way of seeing invisible creatures, the invisible creature gains no benefit against the creature that can see them.</p><p>(9) An example of the &amp;reference[prone] condition:</p><p>A commoner is shoved prone by a zombie. Another zombie then rolls an attack against the commoner, rolling with advantage. A skeleton archer 40 ft. from the commoner then attacks the commoner, rolling the attack roll with disadvantage. Then a second skeleton archer moves to a spot within 5 ft. of the prone commoner, rolling its attack roll without disadvantage or advantage. While normally a point blank shot would have disadvantage, the advantage granted by being within 5 ft. of the prone target causes the roll to be made normally.</p><p>(10) Regarding the &amp;reference[surprise] condition:</p><p>One member of the party may be surprised while others are not. Perhaps the goblins sneaking up on your party caught the ranger's attention, but not the wizard's.</p><p>The GM may decide that the surprised condition is appropriate outside of an ambush. If a doppleganger suddenly sheds their disguise and attacks, the victims are likely surprised, unless they knew the doppleganger was in disguise. Another example would be a supposedly friendly merchant suddenly unleashing a fireball spell upon the party. In this case, you would likely roll the shopkeeper's deception against the party's passive insight scores, similar to stealth in an ambush scenario.</p>",
