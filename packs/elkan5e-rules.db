However, wizards then had to choose which of their spells were actively prepared, which resulted in wizards only having about half their spells available for use on average.  Additionally, the availability of magic scrolls would vary by game table, so wizards became the only casters to rely on gold and magic items to expand their spell list. Additionally, wizards would likely get all the spells they wanted on level up anyway, with any additional spells being random and sometimes not suited to their playstyle.</p><p>In the Elkan 5e wizard, wizards learn as many spells as before, and cannot scribe scrolls to increase that number. However, all spells in their spellbook are prepared at all times. We removed scribing scrolls to equalize wizards a bit with other casters so that they would be just as good in low magic and high magic settings, improving the consistency of balance. Also, because we allowed wizards to have all their spells prepared at all times, we couldn't let them get a number of prepared spells in the hundreds. We decided this was a good trade off, because the already large number of spells wizards could learn meant that having more prepared at once was more important than having more options to switch to at a rest.</p><p>We added the Expertise feature at level 2 to allow wizards to keep up with rogues and bards when it came to specialized skills, especially in cases like with the Arcana skill.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1000000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"ymJDAw0PgXIWIHMH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.NUxwZFBLJvfxIcQa"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":1662403275075,"modifiedTime":1662405640524,"lastModifiedBy":"ymJDAw0PgXIWIHMH"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"2w2vPEpcH9NLYdGH"}

We have made some changes to the armor types available to bring 5e armor closer in line with real world armor.</p><h1>Armor Class</h1><p>​Armor class is an abstract concept that represents how difficult it is for a creature to damage you with an attack. It is usually abbreviated as AC. Every creature has an armor class, which is usually calculated with a combination of their dexterity and the armor they wear.</p><p>If a creature is wearing no armor and has no abilities that increase their AC, their AC is calculated as follows:</p><p>10 + dexterity modifier</p><p>Abilities such as the monk's @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class-features.WjdwOozsQQKHaQnL] provide an alternative way to calculate AC. </p><p></p><p>When a creature makes an attack, their attack roll must be equal to or higher than the AC of their target in order to hit. On a hit, the creature deals damage. A miss usually does nothing.</p><h3>Armor</h3><p>Armor can be worn by player characters or by monsters. The most common kinds of armor in most fantasy worlds range from light armor like leather to heavy armor like plate. NPCs (nonplayer characters) will sometimes have a form of armor called natural armor, which allows them to have a higher AC than is normal.</p><p>Your character may not be proficient in all kinds of armor. For example, a @UUID[Compendium.elkan5e.elkan5e-class.emEIZZAh0s8Ed62c] is normally proficient not proficient with any armor, and a ranger is proficient only with light and medium armor.</p><p>If you wear armor you are not proficient with:</p><ul><li><p>You cannot cast spells</p></li><li><p>You have disadvantage on attack rolls </p></li><li><p>You have disadvantage on strength and dexterity saving throws and ability checks, including skill checks</p></li></ul><h1>Armor Characteristics</h1><p> Below is a list of all armor types. </p><p>​</p><p>Where the armor class of a given armor type is listed, 'dex' means dexterity modifier. The maximum listed on medium armor refers to the total armor class armor can provide when combined with this dexterity bonus.</p><p>​</p><p>If the armor has a strength requirement listed, the character wearing the armor must have a strength score equal to or equal to the number to wear the armor without penalty. If the character has a lower strength than the requirement, their speed is reduced by 10.</p><p>​</p><p>If the armor indicates 'yes' on stealth disadvantage, the wearer of this armor type always has disadvantage on stealth checks while wearing the armor.</p><p>​</p><p>The armor's cost is the armor's normal cost when sold at a good price. Some regions or merchants may charge more than this value.</p><p>​</p><p>We have made a couple adjustments to the armor types available in 5e.

The problem is, there's no reason why studs on leather armor would be very useful, and there's no historical precedence for their use. It's likely that studded leather was created as fantasy armor as a misunderstanding of brigandine, which has metal plates beneath leather riveted in place, which on the outside would look like studded leather armor. Conversely, padded armor in 5e was barely in use, but realistically it would be used by most poor soldiers and beginning adventurers rather than leather. We shuffled things around. See below for more information on our light armor (2).</p><p>​</p><p>Ring Mail is also a fictional armor likely born of misinterpretation. It is supposed to consist of rings fixed to a leather layers, but the rings are not linked together. This was likely fabricated based on medieval depictions of chain mail, which, due to artistic style choices (or artistic incompetence) were often depicted with the chain links drawn as disconnected circles on top of leather coats, rather than as an interconnected mesh. However, these historical depictions were meant to depict chain mail over a leather or cloth padding. Since we, as designers and players of 5e have never had a character wear ring mail, we removed it entirely. Its only function was as starting armor for characters with low strength and dexterity, and ring mail isn't even listed as a starting armor for anyone. In practice we never saw it used, so we didn't replace it.</p><p>​</p><p>@UUID[.BdrD593PiJrHfKFG#light-armor]{(2)} Regarding Light Armor: </p><p>In baseline 5e, the worst light armor is padded armor, and it appears as we feature it here, except that it imposes disadvantage on stealth checks. This made no sense to us, as other armor that includes padded layers did not impose this disadvantage. However, by removing the disadvantage, we made padded just as good as leather armor. However, because we wanted to remove studded leather armor, we simply gave leather armor the statistics that leather armor used to have (with a slight cost decrease).</p><p>​</p><p>However, other 5e materials will still use the old names. If you are using other 5e sources that reference 'studded leather armor', give it the statistics of leather armor as we list it here. They are identical. If other sources list 'leather armor', use the statistics of padded armor here. For example, if you create a character at level 1 that starts with leather armor, then that character should start with padded armor instead. If you accidentally give the armor the statistics of leather armor instead of padded armor, it's no big deal. There's a very small difference and it's only meant to make a character's starting armor slightly worse. If you see padded armor in other 5e material (and it's very rare), improve the padded armor to the statistics we provide here.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.e4uHkTZfHneAGHK6.JournalEntryPage.3Ibt3oHhvX42A3d4"}}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"ymJDAw0PgXIWIHMH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.e4uHkTZfHneAGHK6"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":1662395995509,"modifiedTime":1662400719044,"lastModifiedBy":"ymJDAw0PgXIWIHMH"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"q10XUuFrVlw8qYj1"}

For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.</p><p>Survival: The GM might ask you to make a Survival check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.</p><p>​</p></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id=\"comp-l12qipcl\"><div data-testid=\"columns\"><div id=\"comp-l12qipdx\"><div id=\"bgLayers_comp-l12qipdx\" data-hook=\"bgLayers\"><div id=\"bgMedia_comp-l12qipdx\"><p></p></div></div><div data-mesh-id=\"comp-l12qipdxinlineContent\" data-testid=\"inline-content\"><div data-mesh-id=\"comp-l12qipdxinlineContent-gridContainer\" data-testid=\"mesh-container-content\"><div id=\"comp-l12qipe01\" data-testid=\"richTextElement\"><h2>Charisma Skills</h2><p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Deception: Your Deception skill determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fasttalk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.</span></span></p><p>Intimidation: When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make an Intimidation check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.</p><p>Performance: Your Performance skill determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.</p><p>Persuasion: When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Persuasion check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.</p></div></div></div></div></div></section>","markdown":""},"_id":"9PslP0x9xOgEtPRv","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"ymJDAw0PgXIWIHMH":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":1662399616560,"modifiedTime":1662399662461,"lastModifiedBy":"ymJDAw0PgXIWIHMH"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"rv19GFzEa0nMTuAF"}
