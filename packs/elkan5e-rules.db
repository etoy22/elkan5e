Individuals who grow up speaking a rare language learn a trade language before embarking on adventure.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic</strong>: Spoken by dragons and their servants. Dragonborn and kobolds usually grow up speaking Draconic. Draconic has its own script which is usually hard to read for new readers, as letters can look similar or blend into each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Giant</strong>: Giant is spoken by ogres, trolls, and true giants such as stone or fire giants. Giant and Dwarvish scripts are both derived from Primordial, and those who read Dwarvish can typically read Giant words.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnomish</strong>: Gnomish is a language that rarely makes its way outside of Gnomish communities. It uses Dwarvish script, but some dialects takes a fair amount from Elvish as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Orc</strong>: In many settings Orcs are isolated from other intelligent humanoids. Their language uses the Dwarvish script.</p>\n<p><strong>Thieves' Cant</strong>: Thieves' Cant varies moderately by region, but there are numerous phrases and signs that mean the same thing among criminals across the world. Thieves' Cant is not a formal language, but a series of signs, expressions, and hand signs that convey secret meaning.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ymJDAw0PgXIWIHMH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.TcJtLaAp5mm13BYG"}}}
