{"_id":"LQpXBVFiajZUMQMW","name":"Elkan Monk Notes","content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.elkan5e.com/monk\" target=\"_self\" data-anchor=\"dataItem-kpfwvrui\" data-anchor-comp-id=\"comp-kpfwvrrs\">(1)</a> Besides the more minor changes, the monk has had an increase in their unarmed damage. The monk's ki total has been doubled and moved to a long rest recharge. The monk also no longer uses ki to use stunning strike, which is now its own ability with a number of uses equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest. This prevents the monk from stunning all enemies in a fight or trying to stun a single monster 4 times in a round. It also allows the monk to freely use ki on the other abilities without them competing.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.elkan5e.com/monk\" target=\"_self\" data-anchor=\"dataItem-kpfwyca9\" data-anchor-comp-id=\"comp-kpfwyc90\">(2)</a> If your monk is wearing armor or wielding a shield, you cannot calculate their AC using Unarmored Defense. You also cannot combine this ability with another ability that allows you to calculate your AC in an unusual way. For example, if you also have a level of sorcerer and select the draconic bloodline, your AC can be calculated as 13 + your Dexterity modifier. If you had both features, you would have to pick one (whichever total is higher).</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>@Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-class-features.TkITc38eeDtK0YsP]{(3)} Regarding Monk Weapons: If you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can use your dexterity for the attack roll. The quarterstaff would deal (1d6+dex) in damage if wielded one-handed and (1d8+dex) in damage if wielded two handed. However, a quarterstaff wielded by a level 20 monk would deal (1d12+dex) damage, because the monk's unarmed die is a d12, which is higher than the weapon's normal damage die.</p>\n<p>If the monk was wielding the quarterstaff with one hand, the monk can also make an unarmed strike as part of the attack action. This is in line with our general changes to <a href=\"https://www.elkan5e.com/weapons\" target=\"_self\" data-anchor=\"dataItem-ky0h2ip2\">dual wielding</a>. Unlike dual wielding with weapons, a monk does not need to have the <a href=\"https://www.elkan5e.com/fighter\" target=\"_self\" data-anchor=\"dataItem-kq2voyre1\">Two-Weapon Fighting Style</a> to fight effectively in this way. A monk is trained in making many attacks in a short time.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.elkan5e.com/monk\" target=\"_self\" data-anchor=\"dataItem-kpfwytqj\" data-anchor-comp-id=\"comp-kpfwytp5\">(4)</a> Regarding Flurry of Blows: if your character is holding a two-handed weapon or has an object in both hands, they can still use flurry of blows. This might be described as temporarily removing one hand from a two-handed weapon, attacking with the hilt of a weapon, or kicking the target. Note that while a monk can use Flurry of Blows while both hands are holding a weapon, the monk cannot make the normal additional unarmed strike afforded by  @Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-class-features.TkITc38eeDtK0YsP]{Martial Arts}.</p>\n<p>Normally, a level 1 monk makes one attack using their action, or two attacks if the monk has an empty hand. Flurry of Blows costs 1 ki point to give you one more attack with your bonus action, bringing the total number of attacks to three, or four if you have @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo]{Extra Attack}.</p>\n<p>You can move between these extra attacks, as normal.</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.elkan5e.com/monk\" target=\"_self\" data-anchor=\"dataItem-kpfx03y8\" data-anchor-comp-id=\"comp-kpfx03wy\">(5)</a> Deflect Missiles in action: a guard fires an arrow at a level 8 monk with 16 dexterity. The guard misses, so the monk cannot deflect the arrow. Then another guard shoots another arrow, dealing 7 damage. The monk uses their reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10+11.</p>\n<p>This reduction in damage is calculated as (1d10+8 (level) +3 (dexterity modifier)).</p>\n<p>In this example, monk doesn't even need to roll to block 7 damage. The attack's damage is reduced to 0. The monk then chooses to expend a ki point to redirect the missile, choosing to target a goblin. The monk rolls an attack bonus as if the arrow was a <a href=\"https://www.elkan5e.com/monk\" target=\"_self\" data-anchor=\"dataItem-kpfwyne9\" data-anchor-comp-id=\"comp-kpfwync2\">monk weapon</a>, then deals 1d8+3 damage when it hits.</p>\n<p>The monk would be unable to deflect a scorching ray spell at all, and if a fire giant throws a rock at a monk, the monk cannot catch the massive stone, so the monk could deflect the missile but not redirect it. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.elkan5e.com/monk\" target=\"_self\" data-anchor=\"dataItem-kpfx23w4\" data-anchor-comp-id=\"comp-kpfx23up\">(6)</a> Regarding Stillness of Mind: the previous version of this ability required your action, but we wanted the ability to function, say, if a <a href=\"https://www.elkan5e.com/conditions\" target=\"_self\" data-anchor=\"dataItem-kp4ftj2b\">frightened</a> effect caused you to be <a href=\"https://www.elkan5e.com/conditions\" target=\"_self\" data-anchor=\"dataItem-kp4fx0qa\">paralyzed</a>. This version of the ability still effectively costs your action, but you don't have to be able to use an action to use it. We also wanted this ability to cost ki, so a sufficiently exhausted monk would still be susceptible to mind-altering powers.</p>\n<p>If you are charmed and under the control of another creature, you can use this ability to end the <a href=\"https://www.elkan5e.com/conditions\" target=\"_self\" data-anchor=\"dataItem-kp4fru85\">charmed</a> effect even if the charmer tries to order you to do something else. Note that while a successful save would make you immune to many charm or frighten effects from a given creature, using this ability leaves you susceptible to a repeat of the same effect.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Note you can still use a bonus action on the same turn.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ymJDAw0PgXIWIHMH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ocSPDlXYqBLR8EqW"}}}
{"_id":"tPIGlzdrAnnmdrbi","name":"Elkan Sorcerer Notes","content":"<p>(1) The biggest changes to the sorcerer class revolve around metamagic. We added two metamagic options to flesh out the list from baseline 5e rules, gave sorcerers one more metamagic to their total number, made them get new metamagic options at lower levels than before, and made it so they recover up to half their sorcery point total on a short rest. We also gave them a feature at level 10 that allows them to bolster their wisdom saves for high level play, and we created a new capstone feature to replace their old one, which we invalidated by allowing level 2 and higher sorcerers to regain sorcery points on a short rest. Also, in baseline 5e, sorcery points could be abused to create an unlimited number of spell slots for certain multiclass characters. Our rules here prevent that: sorcerers can no longer create more spell slots on top of their usual maximum.</p>\n<p>There's also a few minor tweaks here and there.</p>\n<p>​@Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-class-features.WGoOmTnF9fKNlyjg]{(2)} Regarding Subtle Spell: This means other creatures will not see or hear you casting the spell, but the spell itself will still be visible and make sound, and may give you away if it originates from you, like a magic missile shooting from your hands. You can also do this while incapable of speaking or moving, provided you can still take actions.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[elkan5e.elkan5e-class-features.L0LJwulAo60HVKUc]{(3)} Regarding Twinned Spell: You may twin a spell if the spell is only targeting one target and is not an area of effect spell.
