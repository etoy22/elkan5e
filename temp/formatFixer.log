Updated value: <p>Dragonborn are humanoid lizards with the blood of dragons running through their veins. In some settings, they are directly descendants of dragons in some way, and in some settings they are created magically by draconic gods. Dragonborn can also refer to half-dragons, the humanoid lizard-like offspring created when a dragon, shapeshifted into a mortal, produces offspring with a mortal.
